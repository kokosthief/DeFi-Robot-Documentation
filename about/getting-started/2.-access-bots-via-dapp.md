# 2. Access suite via Dapp

To get access to the ecosystem, you need to connect your wallet to telegram through our Dapp, which then automatically produces invited links for you depending on your Tier level.

## 1. Navigate to DeFi-Robot helper bot

Once you're holding enough **$DRBT** tokens to qualify for a tier, send the command **`/dapp_match`** to our [DeFi-Robot Helper Bot.](https://t.me/DeFiRobot\_Helper\_Bot)

You will receive a reply with a link to our [Dapp](https://dapp.defirobot.org/) and details needed to connect your Telegram ID to your wallet.

> We've automated the display of your Telegram ID here so you don't have to find it yourself.
