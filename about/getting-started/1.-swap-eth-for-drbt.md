description: Swap Ethereum Coin for our native token DRBT.

# 1. Swap ETH for DRBT

## 1. Go to Uniswap

Visit [https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap) import DRBT token when prompted and then select '**Connect Wallet**'.

Choose your wallet provider and connect your specified wallet to Uniswap.

## 2. Swap ETHH for DRBT

**$DRBT** should be prefilled within the swap criteria when following the link from Step 1.&#x20;

Double check to make sure the contract address matches the one below:

{% code title="Contract Address" %}
```solidity
0x661013bB8D1C95D86D9C85f76E9004561
```
{% endcode %}

If not simply copy and paste it into the swap.

Using the example of swapping **ETH** for **DRBT** to access Tier 3.

6,000,000 **DRBT** are required for Tier 3, however with the buy tax of **5%** we'll need to swap a little  more.

{% hint style="info" %}
Buy tax: **4%** (team) + **1%** (liquidity pool) = **5%**
{% endhint %}

Add our 6 M + 5% buy tax.

$$6000000 * 1.05 5 = 6300000$$

Therefore, type **6300000** into the swap and in the settings panel change the slippage to between **6-10%** which should be enough to include buy tax as well as price variability.

Select '**Swap**' and '**Confirm Swap**'.
