# List Functions

DeFi-Robot Simulator enables you to quickly list all the functions of a contract token address, even if it is not a verified contract.

### List functions in three steps

1. Select or type **`/start`**
2. Paste contract address
3. Select **`List Functions`**

{% hint style="success" %}
Within each listing, the contract simulator automatically runs this function to determine the enable trading method. If it finds one, it will also include this within the Simulation section of every post.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
