# Liquidity Pool

DeFi-Robot Simulator enables you to quickly run a command to view the liquidity pool of a token.

### View liquidity pool in three steps

1. Select or type **`/start`**
2. Paste contract address
3. Select **`Liquidity Pool`**

{% hint style="success" %}
### Within each listing, the contract simulator also automatically runs this function to determine the liquidity pool.
{% endhint %}

### **This tool is useful to see the distribution of liquidity**

If the liquidity reading indicates the total supply is 50%, that likely means the developer kept aside 50% for himself.
