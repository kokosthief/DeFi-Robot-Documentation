# Contracts

There are two bots, one for ETH and one for Binance that operate identically the same.

## All new contract

This channel bot lists all new contracts deployed on their respective blockchains.&#x20;

Each listing dynamically updates when new information becomes available, continually for 90 minutes or up until (if) the contract rugs.

View the previous page [Channels](./) to learn more about each individual section of every new live contract listing.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Not each listing will be the same**

For example, all listings that come through will provide contract simulation results, but not all will include socials produced from a verified contract.

**Get access**
