## Four functions

* [List functions](list-functions.md)
* [Quick Simulator](quick-simulation.md)
* [Liquidity Pool Check](liquidity-pool.md)
* [Advanced Simulation](./#advanced-simulation)

{% hint style="info" %}
**List Functions, Quick Simulator and LP Check are all implemented within each** [**listings channel**](../../channels/)**.**

Both the quick simulation and liquidity pool check functions are automatically run every time a live listing get's published. What's more, every dynamic live listing can list a contract's functions as well as re-launch the quick simulator in one click.
