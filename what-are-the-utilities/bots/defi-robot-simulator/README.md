# DeFi-Robot Simulator

This bot is very powerful in the hands of those who know how to use it.&#x20;

### The Simulator Bot utility has four functions:

* [List functions](list-functions.md)
* [Quick Simulator](quick-simulation.md)
* [Liquidity Pool Check](liquidity-pool.md)
* [Advanced Simulation](./#advanced-simulation)

To be used as a dashboard to efficiently gather the data needed for method sniping.

Each function can be performed within the DeFi-Robot Simulator Telegram bot at any time by typing **`/start`** and pasting a token's contract address.

### Most functions are implemented within listings channels

Every tier benefits from the Simulator Bot as it is embedded across the ecosystem. &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Only the advanced simulation is reserved for Tier 3 users
{% endhint %}

Demonstrated below in an example [ETH Deployer](../../channels/eth-bsc-deployer.md) channel post, other tiers have the ability to:

* Decompile contract and [List Functions](list-functions.md) even on unverified contracts
* See initial contract simulation and re-launch a [Quick Simulation](./#quick-simulation)
* View [Liquidity Pool](liquidity-pool.md)&#x20;

### List functions or re-launch contract simulation in two clicks

As shown below, within the message received from one of three live listing channels, simply select their respective link to interact with the Simulator Bot.

{% hint style="info" %}
* **Tier** **1** can **`List Functions`**
* **Tiers 2 and 3** can**`Re-Launch`** the light contract simulator
{% endhint %}
