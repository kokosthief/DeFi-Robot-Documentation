It's possible for Tier 3 users, to perform an advanced simulation at any time with any token contract address using the dedicated DeFi-Robot Simulator bot.

### Run an advanced simulation in three steps

3. Select **`Advanced Simulation`**

Advanced simulator allows the user to call any function of a contract, even prior to launch, to check what would be the impact on taxes and the possibility of buying & selling, block to block.&#x20;

It's a powerful dashboard to quickly check contract's LP, taxes, and functions all within telegram and exclusive to Tier 3 users.
