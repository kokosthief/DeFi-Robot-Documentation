# ETH/BSC Awake

For Tier 3 users only there are two listing bots called BSC/ETH Awake.&#x20;

## Live new contracts, filtered by the recently awaken contracts

Under certain criteria they parse listings, just as you would expect to see them come through the main ETH/BSC Live Listings channel. Awake bot has contracts that have been inactive for quite some time sometimes (or sleeping), when they wake, you get the alert.

### This listing bot monitors contracts that pass the following conditions:

* Token was created more than 2 hours prior
* Trading not enabled yet
* Dev just approved the contract

{% hint style="info" %}
Usually the developer approves a contract right before adding the liquidity pool.
{% endhint %}

It's a great bot to help find those stealth / insider launches which might go unnoticed otherwise. But definitely not a whole solution for finding them.

> Under good market conditions Awake will find at least one good mooner per day.

It's recommended to check the developer wallet first if a token comes through the Alert channel, to properly DYOR and investigate what is going on. Find their socials, check their telegram group, view the developer wallet; usually an old wallet with txs and socials is good sign.
