description: Decipher all new live pairs in one place with real-time updates.

# ETH/BSC

There are two bots, one for ETH and one for Binance that operate identically the same.

## ETH/BSC lists every new live pair

This channel bot lists all new contracts deployed on their respective blockchains.&#x20;

Each listing dynamically updates when new information becomes available, continually for 90 minutes or up until (if) the contract rugs.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Not each listing will be the same**:&#x20;

For example, all listings that come through will provide contract simulation results, but not all will include socials produced from a verified contract.
{% endhint %}

View the section in Channels to learn more about each individual section of each listing.
