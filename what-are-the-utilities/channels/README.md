# Channels

## Live and dynamic listing channels

The most impressive part of the DeFi-Robot are the live and dynamic live pairs that come through the three Telegram channel on the Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain and Arbitrum blockchains.

### [ETH/BSC](eth-bsc-contracts.md)&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
Lists all new contracts.
{% endhint %}

### [ETH/BSC Deployer](eth-bsc-deployer.md)

{% hint style="success" %}
Lists all new contracts where dev had a previous moonshot >50k.
{% endhint %}

### [ETH/BSC Awake](eth-bsc-awake.md)&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Lists previously sleeping contracts which have awoken because of dev activity.
{% endhint %}

All three will produce a contract listing message which looks like this:

<details>

<summary>Token, CA, Dev etc.</summary>

First section of each listing always contains the token name, contract address and the corresponding trading ticker.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Bytecode hashes </summary>

Included are three hashes all clickable so you can quickly cross-reference previous launches for matching hashes.&#x20;

This is useful to see which past projects with matching hashes were scams and which ones were not.

**1. Bytecode Hash**

Where the bytecode of the contract is hashed.

#### 2. Functions Hash

Where the contract functions list and callable functions are hashed.

#### 3. Functions + Funding Hash

Where the contract functions and the funding source of developer's wallet (Binance, Coinbase, ...) are hashed together.&#x20;

Usually a dev use same DEX so could be useful to find all other contracts, with same hash, from same DEX.

There are three ways the simulator is embedded within each live listing.

1.  ### List functions or re-launch contract simulation in two clicks
