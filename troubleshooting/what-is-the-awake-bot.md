# What is the Awake bot?

The [Awake](../utilities/launch-scanners/awake.md) listing channel finds sleeping contracts and notifies you when they come back awake.

Hence why they are described as becoming "awake".&#x20;

A sleeping contract means it has been created already sometime ago, but only recently there is new developer activity indicating it may launch soon.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Useful because**:

These kind of contracts can often indicate a project is an insider play or stealth launch.
{% endhint %}
