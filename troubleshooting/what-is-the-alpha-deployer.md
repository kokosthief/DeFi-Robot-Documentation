# What is the Alpha Deployer?

## Contracts filtered by deployers with previous moonshots + up to 5 connected wallets&#x20;

Alpha **Deployer** is special as this launch scanner only lists contracts after searchings across (upto) five connected wallets by "jumping" from one to the next, to discover previous moonshots from an array of connected wallets.
