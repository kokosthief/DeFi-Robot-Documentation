# How does the tier 3 differ from tier 2?

Head over to the [Tiers](../about/tiers.md) for a detailed overview of how each Tier differs from the other.&#x20;

The big advantages of Tier 3 is that users get access to the ETH Awake channel and the [Exclusive Bot](../utilities/analysis-tools/advanced-bot/), which has the ability to run fast and useful [Token](../utilities/analysis-tools/advanced-bot/token-check.md) and [Wallet](../utilities/analysis-tools/advanced-bot/wallet-check.md) checks on-demand

Tier 3 users also get access to the [Exclusive Chat](../utilities/group-chats/exclusive-chat.md) used by pro snipers whom only share top quality alpha.
