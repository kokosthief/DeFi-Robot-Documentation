# How does the tier 3 differ from tier 2?

Head over to the [Tiers](../what-is-defi-robot/alpha-bots-and-analytics/tiers.md) for a detailed overview of how each Tier differs from the other.&#x20;

The big advantages of Tier 3 is that users get access to the ETH Awake channel and the [Exclusive Bot](../what-are-the-utilities/alpha-bots/advanced-bot/), which has the ability to run fast and useful [Token](../what-are-the-utilities/alpha-bots/advanced-bot/token-check.md) and [Wallet](../what-are-the-utilities/alpha-bots/advanced-bot/wallet-check.md) checks on-demand

Tier 3 users also get access to the [Exclusive Chat](../what-are-the-utilities/group-chats/exclusive-chat.md) used by pro snipers whom only share top quality alpha.
