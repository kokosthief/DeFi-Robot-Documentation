# Contracts

All Launch scanners entitled Contracts work the same for ETH, BSC and Arbitrum.

## All new contract

This channel bot lists all new contracts deployed on their respective blockchains.&#x20;

Each listing dynamically updates when new information becomes available, continually for 90 minutes or up until (if) the contract rugs.

View the [Launch Scanners](./) to learn more about what each individual section of every new live contract deployment listing can include.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Not each listing will be the same**

For example, all listings that come through will provide contract simulation results, but not all will include socials produced from a verified contract.
