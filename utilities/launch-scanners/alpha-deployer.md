## Contracts filtered by deployers with previous moonshots + up to 5 connected wallets&#x20;

Alpha **Deployer** filters contracts where the developers have had at least one successful past project where the total volume exceeded 100K (ETH) and searchings across (upto) five connected wallets by "jumping" from one to the next.

**Alpha Deployer** filters contracts on the following conditions:

* The deployer has already had at least one moonshot
* Trading not enabled yet

And then searches across multiple deployer wallets that are connected up to five jumps.

### You can expect to see

A typic launch scanner listing from [Contracts](contracts.md) that includes the **Dev's Previous Best Token** section plus another message below showing connected wallets and previous launches.

**Tip:**

Previous deployments with ~~strikethrough~~ are rugged. Validators blacklist these devs in DeFi-Robot so they won't appear in other launch scanners, but with Alpha Deployer the user decides if they want to interact with that token launch.
