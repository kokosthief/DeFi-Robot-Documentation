# Alpha Deployer

## Live new contracts, filtered by deployer with previous moonshot

The two listing bots called **BSC/ETH Deployer** filter contracts where the developer has had at least one successful past project where the total volume exceeded 50K (BSC) / 100K (ETH)

### This bot filters all contracts where:&#x20;

* The deployer has already had at least one moonshot
* Trading not enabled yet

It's always recommended still to DYOR and check to see if other scams or rugs used matching hash byte codes.

### You can expect to see
