# Awake

> For **Tier 3 users only** there are two listing bots called BSC/ETH Awake.&#x20;

## Contracts filtered by the recently becoming awake

Under certain criteria they parse listings, just as you would expect to see them come through the main ETH/BSC [Contracts Launch Scanner](contracts.md).&#x20;

However, the Awake bot only includes contracts that have been inactive (sleeping), until this point, whereby they are becoming awake with developer activity.

**Awake** filters contracts on the following conditions:

* Token was created more than 2 hours prior
* Trading not enabled yet
* Dev just approved the contract

> Usually the **developer** approves a contract right before adding liquidity to the pool.

Useful to help find stealth or insider launches which might go unnoticed otherwise.

{% hint style="info" %}
It's recommended to check the developer wallet first if a token comes through the Alert channel, to properly DYOR and investigate the token launch.
